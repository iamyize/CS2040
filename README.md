# CS2040 Data Structure and Algorithm AY20/21 

## Introduction
These are the notes for CS2040 from when I was an undergraduate student at NUS (that was a long time ago). And this is a very important, if not the most important courses. 


## Basic Concepts Covered: 
1. sorting algorithms
2. list
3. stacks and queue
4. hashing 
5. heaps
6. UFDS
7. tree
8. graphs

## Workload

1. Lectures (2 hours per section, 2 sections per week) - to cover the concepts and sample code
2. Labs (2 hours per week), and you need to use approx. one day to finish the lab 
3. Assignments (2 questions per two weeks)
4. Tutorials (45 minutes per week) need to prepare beforehand hand 
5. Other quizzes, usually graded, depend on the lecturer... 

So in summary, it does take a lot of time and the learning curve can be quite steep.
